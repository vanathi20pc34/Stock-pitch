This stock pitcher allows us to search using the finnhub api key. It gives us lots of options based upon the api calls. Here I have also used tailwind css. 
It has a search bar which alows the user to search for a company stock.
Then at the right side there are 2 columns.
1st column displays the on going stock value.
2nd column displays the name, country, currency, indurty etc of the company. Basically it displays the details of the company.
Then there is a chart to check for specific date filters like 1 day or week or month or year.
Unfortunately it is not being displayed.
